# Bayesian Networks - Risk of Traffic Congestion

This project contains the design and documentation for two variants of a Bayesian network solution for predicting the risk of traffic congestion at the entrance of the fictional Meridonia City Hospital and the implementation of an agent that is able to construct a Bayesian network and make probabilistic inferences using the variable elimination algorithm.

## Installation and Usage

In order to run the program implementing the Bayesian inference agent, first navigate to the base directory, CS5011 P3. Then, in order to run the program using the already compiled source code, use the following command:

```bash
java -cp out/production/CS5011_P3 A3main
```

In order to re-compile the source code, you may use the following command:

 ```bash
javac -d out/production/CS5011_P3 A3src/*.java
```

## Report

See CS5011_P3.pdf for a complete report, containing installation and usage instructions.
